HOW TO DEPLOY TALOS TO AWS - TELL CLAUDE THIS:
=====================================================

"Deploy my Talos backend to AWS using App Runner or Railway.

Location: C:\Users\13019\talos-website\backend-node
Database: PostgreSQL RDS already running
Status: Code works perfectly locally, just needs cloud deployment

Use the simplest method that will actually work.
The better-sqlite3 issue is already fixed."
